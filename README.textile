githubarchive-parser is used to load locally stored "GitHub Archive":http://www.githubarchive.org/ files, based on the above schema.  It uses "Gremlin":https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki to create a "Titan":http://thinkaurelius.github.com/titan/ graph database.  It makes use of batch loading tools provided by "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com.

Getting started:

First download as much of the GitHub Archive as you want to load.  To get everything to date:

@mkdir /tmp/githubarchive@
@cd /tmp/githubarchive@
@for i in {3..10}@
    @do@
        @wget http://data.githubarchive.org/2012-`printf "%02d" $i`-{01..31}-{0..23}.json.gz &@
    @done@


Next you will need a version of Titan built with Groovy 1.8.8 or later, due to a known bug with json parsing in Groovy 1.8.6.  Gremlin 2.1.0 uses Groovy 1.8.6, but Gremlin 2.2.0-SNAPSHOT uses Groovy 1.8.8.

To start loading, first review the options at the beginning of ImportGitHubArchive.groovy then do

@gremlin -e ImportGitHubArchive.groovy@

Loading all of the data from the start of the archive in 2012-03 through the end of 2012-09 took me just under 9 hours on a single desktop machine.  When it is finished you should see a summary like this:


@Done. Summary:@
@18482214 events@
@17009381 vertices@
@47704461 edges@
@32357.591 seconds elapsed@
